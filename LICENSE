LPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04

Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.


PREAMBLE
========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the
LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which
you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly suitable if your work
is directly related to the LaTeX system (e.g., a LaTeX package), but it is
written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to
LaTeX.

The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below,
gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are
considering distributing their works under this license.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and
modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may
be distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom
to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with
whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability,
integrity, and reliability of that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your
goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and
`modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.


DEFINITIONS
===========

In this license document the following terms are used:

   `Work'
      Any work being distributed under this License.

   `Derived Work'
      Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

   `Modification'
      Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for
e      example, the production of a file containing an original file associated
      with the Work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or
      with modifications and/or translated into another language.

   `Modify'
      To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
      law.

   `Distribution'
      Making copies of the Work available to the public by any means.
      Including, but not limited to, downloading from or placing on a network
      server, or making available on a data storage medium.

   `Compiled Work'
      A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is
      directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may include using
      installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations performed by
      a LaTeX installation process, or by a third-party processor.

   `Current Maintainer'
      A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is no
      such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any
      applicable law.

   `Base Interpreter'
      A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting
      a part of the Work.

      A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not
      considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each external
      component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively.
      Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the
      only applicable Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of
      files belonging to the `LaTeX-Format' a program implementing the
      `TeX language'.


CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===========================================

1.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received
    it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered modification of
    the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived Work may be assumed
    under the terms of this clause.

2.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete,
    unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 1 above, as long as
    that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may
    install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it would have been
    installed if they generated a Compiled Work from the Work.

3.  You may modify your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You
    may also distribute such Derived Works as defined in clause 4, provided
    that you also meet all of the following conditions:

    a.  If you modify a file of the Work, you must cause all modified files to
        carry prominent notices so that any recipient will know that they are
        not receiving the original file.

    b.  You must cause any Derived Work that you distribute to be licensed as a
        whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
        License, with the exception of Compiled Works that meet the conditions
        of clause 2 above.  This condition does not require any part of a
        Derived Work that is a Compiled Work to be made available in any source
        code form.

    c.  If the Work has a `LaTeX-Format' identification string then you must
        not remove or alter that identification string in any source code file
        you distribute, except that you may alter the identification string if
        your modification constitutes a `Maintained' modification as described
        in clause 5, and you meet the conditions set out in clause 5.

4.  You may distribute a Derived Work provided that you are in compliance with
    the above clauses 1 to 3.

5.  A modification is a `Maintained' modification only if there is a Current
    Maintainer of the Work, and that person or persons releases an updated
    version of the Work that is intended to supersede all previous versions
    and to which the modification has been contributed.  In this case the
    Current Maintainer may allow you to alter the identification string to
    indicate that your file is based on the updated version.

6.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply
to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes
identical to an updated version of that component as distributed by the Current
Maintainer under Clause 1.

7.  If a Derived Work contains any file that is not a direct modification of a
    file in the Work, then you may additionally distribute that file under any
    license you choose, provided that you also meet all of the following
    conditions:

    a.  The license you choose must not contradict the intent or purpose of any
        part of this License.

    b.  You must cause any such file to carry prominent notices so that any
        recipient will know that the file is not part of the Work.

    c.  You must license any such file as a whole at no charge to all third
        parties under the terms of the license you choose.

8.  This license does not grant any right to use any trademark, service mark,
    tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder or the LaTeX3 Project except as
    is necessary to comply with clause 3c.

9.  If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the
    applicable law then that part shall be interpreted in a fashion that
    comes as close as possible to reflecting the original intent, while
    remaining in compliance with the applicable law.  The remaining parts
    will remain in full force and effect.
